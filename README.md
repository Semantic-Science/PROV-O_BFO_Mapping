# PROV-O BFO Mapping
PROV is to be mapped to, or extended from, the BFO/CCO taxonomy, for the pur-pose of elevating provenance representation out of the old form, and into an ISO/IEC compliant one.

Both the PROV model and BFO can be had in various serializations, e.g., XML, OWL, etc. BFO is also serialized in Common Logic (CL), which possesses the full expressivity of FOL [36]. For the purpose of the present paper, the OWL serializations of PROV and BFO are used, because the rendering of selected statements in the Terse Triple Language (TTL) format is amenable for both understanding and brevity; moreover, the CCO are only found in TTL format; so, OWL is most useful here. Fol-lowing are the versions of each ontology utilized in this mapping:

*	PROV-O: recommendation version 2013-04-30
*	BFO: 2020, from 2024-01-29
*	CCO: 1.5, from 2024-02-14

* Placeholder URI base used for demarcating the mapped terms

## PROV-O Class Mapping

### PROV-O Core Class Mapping
The mapping begins with the three Core, or “Starting Point” classes of PROV-O. The Core classes are the basis of PROV-O, allowing for the creation of simple provenance descriptions.

### PROV-O Expanded Class Mapping
Built atop the Core category of terms, PROV-O Expanded terms allow for more fine-grained provenance descriptions.

### PROV-O Qualified Class Mapping

## PROV-O Property Mapping

### PROV-O Core Property Mapping

### PROV-O Expanded Property Mapping

### PROV-O Qualified Property Mapping
